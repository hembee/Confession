              <p>
                Some people talk about love at first sight shit<br />
                to keep it hunnid, I don't know if it's real or realer<br />
                but tell if I'm wrong or right if<br />
                I fell in love with her before I even got to know her
              </p>
              <p>
                I was hanging with my friends from the next street <br />
                talking 'bout life and ways to make the ends meet <br />
                One topic to another,her name came up<br />
                Homie Baleen was talking,had my brain blown-up
              </p>
              <p>
                In my mind "I'm perfect for her I gotta show her"<br />
                "this is the girl of my dreams man, I wanna know her"
              </p>
              <p>
                He told me she had a man and I was heartbroken<br />
                on the other hand I'm happy for her,wished her the best<br />
                I said if it doesn't work out for them don't you forget <br />
                I just hope the split doesn't make her too broken
              </p>
              <p>
                Years later he told me to send some pictures of me<br />
                told me to relax, he's got a lil something for me<br />
                He sent me her number saying "Don't fall my hands"<br />
                that's Aminat's number bro,this is your fucking chance
              </p>
              <p>
                Man I was nervous cos it's hard in the beginning<br />
                But she had that vibe and then I started digging in<br />
                I’m shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger<br />
                She could be my babe, and I could be her fucking nigga
              </p>
              <p>
                First meeting was a vibe,it was hell of a ride<br />
                Smooth flow like the ocean,drifting on with the tide <br />
                we both have a lot in common like we got family ties<br />
                Had to use Google maps cos I was lost in her eyes .

            <div class="item__content-text">
              <p>
               Lemme tell you some things about the girl I love<br/>
The one I'll never place no other girl above<br/>
I call her coconut-head, she's so close-minded <br/>
What she like to do is sew, she's so clothes-minded 
              </p>
              <p>
                I love her curves but I prefer her intelligence quotient<br/>
Hard girl from the trenches but she's full of emotions <br/>
Summer body or not, boy she's fly as hell<br/>
Masculine massacre when she fixes her hair
              </p>
              <p>
                And yeah,she's fragile so you know you gotta handle with care</br/>
cos the last thing you want to see is her eyes filled with tears 
              </p>
              <p>
                She's been through a lot of SHIT but she still smell nice<br/>
don't try to see her bad side, that's a piece of advice
              </p>
              <p>so sweet- she spits in your cup,she'll sweeten your coffee <br/>
I know you're prolly wondering if she'll do it for free<br/>
don't fall in love with her you're gonna get frenetic<br/>
and don't try to kiss her if you are fucking diabetic </p>
<p>Great sense of humor too like Tiffany Haddish<br/>
Call her Casper the ghost with the way she vanish </p>
<p>She adorable and she's got a heart of gold <br/>
The eye of the beholder couldn't handle her, beauty overload <br/>
Sometimes I wonder why the world gon do her like that<br/>
sneaking glances thanking God that He drew her like that</p>
<p>Yeah she loves apple that's her favorite fruit<br/>
Overthinking everything , that's her favorite food</p>
<p>Her brain moves a little different when she's hungry or stressed<br/>
when she's cold in the morning, when she's tired or vexed<br/>
And she'll say she's sorry if you're mad, that's a big blessing<br/>
She'll try to change and then go back to her default settings </p>
<p>You gotta love her for who she is <br/>
or you can walk away and lose a G (gem)<br/>
bad girl with fashion sense and a lot of skills<br/>
now that's a girl with whom I want to be</p>

                To me love means absolute trust without limit and ability to
                sacrifice everything for the one you love to be happy. To be
                honest whenever you told me about your boyfriend, I never really
                felt bad or stopped loving you but whenever he hurt and made you
                cry.It hurt me the most. At one point I felt like killing this
                guy to make you quit the relationship because I felt your pain
                too.
              </p>
              <p>
                I know you love me as your friend but might not be in love with
                me. Don't say you love me if you don’t mean it. Because I might
                do something stupid like believe it. We are different in so many
                ways but I think our differeces have held us this long for a
                reason.
              </p>
              <p>
                My joy has always been seeing you happy and if you don’t accept
                me; that would be absolutely fine. I don’t need you to force
                feelings for me. I have had heartbreaks and countless sleepless
                nights. I don’t really care what will happen to me but rather
                care about how its gonna affect you.

              <p>
                Am neither a good writer nor good enough a lover for you. Am not
                even handsome, by the way not even close your current lover.
                Just look at that 👆👆👆👆. This is just the best way I can use
                to tell you. I was told that I found love where I wasn’t
                supposed to.
              </p>
              <p>
                They all came-in and left me broken in pieces and in pain. You
                never realised that you were the cure that I need to heal. Ever
                since you we found each other love became my religion and you
                became my faith. You were the first woman who made me feel love,
                real and worth something. You are my true love and I want it
                more than anything for you to be my last love now and forever.
              </p>
              <p>
                You recently told me about your love triangle having two guys in
                it. I imagined my self being one of them and I loved it. I have
                memories of you that I will hold unto for the rest of my life if
                anything goes wrong. Am sorry for letting you down because of my
                selfish desires. I know was supposed to be a friend not more and
                I hate myself for this. May be someday you will find it in your
                hear to forgive me and take me back as your own friend.
              </p>
              <p>
                I may not be the most <b>IMPORTANT</b> person in your life. But
                I just <b>HOPE</b> that one day when you <b>HEAR</b> my name,
                You would just <b>SMILE</b> and say "I <b>MISS</b> you very
                much."
