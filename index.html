              <p>
                Some people talk about love at first sight shit<br />
                to keep it hunnid, I don't know if it's real or realer<br />
                but tell if I'm wrong or right if<br />
                I fell in love with her before I even got to know her
              </p>
              <p>
                I was hanging with my friends from the next street <br />
                talking 'bout life and ways to make the ends meet <br />
                One topic to another,her name came up<br />
                Homie Baleen was talking,had my brain blown-up
              </p>
              <p>
                In my mind "I'm perfect for her I gotta show her"<br />
                "this is the girl of my dreams man, I wanna know her"
              </p>
              <p>
                He told me she had a man and I was heartbroken<br />
                on the other hand I'm happy for her,wished her the best<br />
                I said if it doesn't work out for them don't you forget <br />
                I just hope the split doesn't make her too broken
              </p>
              <p>
                Years later he told me to send some pictures of me<br />
                told me to relax, he's got a lil something for me<br />
                He sent me her number saying "Don't fall my hands"<br />
                that's Aminat's number bro,this is your fucking chance
              </p>
              <p>
                Man I was nervous cos it's hard in the beginning<br />
                But she had that vibe and then I started digging in<br />
                I’m shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger<br />
                She could be my babe, and I could be her fucking nigga
              </p>
              <p>
                First meeting was a vibe,it was hell of a ride<br />
                Smooth flow like the ocean,drifting on with the tide <br />
                we both have a lot in common like we got family ties<br />
                Had to use Google maps cos I was lost in her eyes .

            <div class="item__content-text">
              <p>
               Lemme tell you some things about the girl I love<br/>
The one I'll never place no other girl above<br/>
I call her coconut-head, she's so close-minded <br/>
What she like to do is sew, she's so clothes-minded 
              </p>
              <p>
                I love her curves but I prefer her intelligence quotient<br/>
Hard girl from the trenches but she's full of emotions <br/>
Summer body or not, boy she's fly as hell<br/>
Masculine massacre when she fixes her hair
              </p>
              <p>
                And yeah,she's fragile so you know you gotta handle with care</br/>
cos the last thing you want to see is her eyes filled with tears 
              </p>
              <p>
                She's been through a lot of SHIT but she still smell nice<br/>
don't try to see her bad side, that's a piece of advice
              </p>
              <p>so sweet- she spits in your cup,she'll sweeten your coffee <br/>
I know you're prolly wondering if she'll do it for free<br/>
don't fall in love with her you're gonna get frenetic<br/>
and don't try to kiss her if you are fucking diabetic </p>
<p>Great sense of humor too like Tiffany Haddish<br/>
Call her Casper the ghost with the way she vanish </p>
<p>She adorable and she's got a heart of gold <br/>
The eye of the beholder couldn't handle her, beauty overload <br/>
Sometimes I wonder why the world gon do her like that<br/>
sneaking glances thanking God that He drew her like that</p>
<p>Yeah she loves apple that's her favorite fruit<br/>
Overthinking everything , that's her favorite food</p>
<p>Her brain moves a little different when she's hungry or stressed<br/>
when she's cold in the morning, when she's tired or vexed<br/>
And she'll say she's sorry if you're mad, that's a big blessing<br/>
She'll try to change and then go back to her default settings </p>
<p>You gotta love her for who she is <br/>
or you can walk away and lose a G (gem)<br/>
bad girl with fashion sense and a lot of skills<br/>
now that's a girl with whom I want to be</p>

                I know you love me as your friend but might not be in love with
                me. Don't say you love me if you don’t mean it. Because I might
                do something stupid like believe it. We are different in so many
                ways but I think our differeces have held us this long for a
                reason.
              </p>
              <p>
                My joy has always been seeing you happy and if you don’t accept
                me; that would be absolutely fine. I don’t need you to force
                feelings for me. I have had heartbreaks and countless sleepless
                nights. I don’t really care what will happen to me but rather
                care about how its gonna affect you.

              <p>
                The past has been unfriendly to you<br/>
And I understand this burden is kinda heavy for you<br/>
I just want you to be merry and be happy for two<br/>
Like you were with me on our first rendezvous

              <p>
                Through the smooth and the rough <br/>

The easy and the tough <br/>
I'll show you nothing but love

              <p>
                A lot of time you tried to push me away<br/>
was tryna show you these feelings never decay<br/>
so allow me to introduce myself once again as I say... <br/>
