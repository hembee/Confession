              <p>
                Some people talk about love at first sight shit<br />
                to keep it hunnid, I don't know if it's real or realer<br />
                but tell if I'm wrong or right if<br />
                I fell in love with her before I even got to know her
              </p>
              <p>
                I was hanging with my friends from the next street <br />
                talking 'bout life and ways to make the ends meet <br />
                One topic to another, her name came up<br />
                Homie Baleen was talking, had my brain blown-up
              </p>
              <p>
                In my mind "I'm perfect for her I gotta show her"<br />
                "this is the girl of my dreams man, I wanna know her"
              </p>
              <p>
                He told me she had a man and I was heartbroken<br />
                on the other hand I was happy for her, wished her the best<br />
                I said if it doesn't work out for them don't you forget <br />
                I just hope the split doesn't make her too broken
              </p>
              <p>
                Years later he told me to send some pictures of me<br />
                told me to relax, he's got a lil something for me<br />
                He sent me her number saying "Don't fall my hands"<br />
                that's Aminat's number bro, this is your fucking chance
              </p>
              <p>
                Man I was nervous cos it's hard in the beginning<br />
                But she had that vibe and then I started digging in<br />
                I’m shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger<br />
                She could be my babe, and I could be her fucking nigga
              </p>
              <p>
                First meeting was a vibe, it was hell of a ride<br />
                Smooth flow like the ocean, drifting on with the tide <br />
                we both have a lot in common like we got family ties<br />
                Had to use Google maps cos I was lost in her eyes .

            <h4 class="item__content-subtitle">Some things about Her, can't say all lol</h4>
            <div class="item__content-text">
              <p>
               Lemme tell you some things about the girl I love<br/>
The one I'll never place no other girl above<br/>
I call her coconut-head, she's so close-minded <br/>
What she like to do is sew, she's so clothes-minded 
              </p>
              <p>
                I love her curves but I prefer her intelligence quotient<br/>
Hard girl from the trenches but she's full of emotions <br/>
Summer body or not, boy she's fly as hell<br/>
Masculine massacre when she fixes her hair
              </p>
              <p>
                And yeah,she's fragile so you know you gotta handle with care</br/>
cos the last thing you want to see is her eyes filled with tears 
              </p>
              <p>
                She's been through a lot of SHIT but she still smell nice<br/>
don't try to see her bad side, that's a piece of advice
              </p>
              <p>So sweet- she spits in your cup, she'll sweeten your coffee <br/>
I know you're prolly wondering if she'll do it for free<br/>
Don't fall in love with her you're gonna get frenetic<br/>
and don't try to kiss her if you are fucking diabetic </p>
<p>Great sense of humor too like Tiffany Haddish<br/>
Call her Casper the ghost with the way she vanish </p>
<p>She adorable and she's got a heart of gold <br/>
The eye of the beholder couldn't handle her, beauty overload <br/>
Sometimes I wonder why the world gon do her like that<br/>
sneaking glances thanking God that He drew her like that</p>
<p>Yeah she loves apple that's her favorite fruit<br/>
Overthinking everything , that's her favorite food</p>
<p>Her brain moves a little different when she's hungry or stressed<br/>
when she's cold in the morning, when she's tired or vexed<br/>
And she'll say she's sorry if you're mad, that's a big blessing<br/>
She'll try to change and then go back to her default settings </p>
<p>You gotta love her for who she is <br/>
or you can walk away and lose a G (gem)<br/>
bad girl with fashion sense and a lot of skills<br/>
now that's a girl with whom I want to be</p>

            <h4 class="item__content-subtitle"> A software developer developed soft feelings for you</h4>
            <div class="item__content-text">
              <p>
                They say love is the perfect prison, inescapable<br/>
I'm ready to do the time girl,I know I'm capable<br/>
Connection so strong like a good Wi-Fi <br/>
I'm here to stay forever baby, no goodbye 
              </p>
              <p>
                What do i gotta do to show how much you mean to me?<br/>
the happiness you bring when you are nice to me<br/>
I would be lying if I told you true love isn't real<br/>
an ocean full of words can't even express how I feel 
              </p>
              <p>
                I'd do anything just to see your beautiful smile<br/>
And I won't quit until you are finally mine<br/>
No hour has passed without me thinking of you<br/>
even in my sleep, I just hope the dreams come true
              </p>
              <p>And while I'm looking for a way to your heart<br/>
I'm praying to the good Lord that we never part<br/>
take it from a man that loves who you are<br/>
the way you light me up girl I'm sure you're a star </p>
<p>in a world full of fake niggas and cheats<br/>
and playboys that only want baby mamas and shit <br/>
that makes the world feel like real ones don't exist<br/>
you should see it in my eyes I'm one hunnid legit </p>
<p>I wanna be yours<br/>
Till they can't spell trust without us<br/>
ready to adjust<br/>
girl this type of love is robust </p>
<p>I wanna be your lover,your best friend and your man<br/>
your Batman, Spider-Man and your  Superman<br/>
The one you call when you're hurt to heal you up<br/>
whenever you need a long cuddle to cheer you up </p>
<p>So forget all the hurt and let's heal together<br/>
I know it's easy to say and it might take forever <br/>
Look at you, unbelievably, brilliant beautiful you<br/>
I want to stay in your heart darling, I truly do</p>
<p>You're like a flower that I gotta protect<br/>
To keep alive in harsh weather, make sure it's wet<br/>
You're way more than a friend to me,more like fam<br/>
Let's work on our flaws together till we can say God-damn!</p>
<p>Being with you is a top priority<br/>
There's no need to question the authority<br/>
I was taught to pursue my dreams, so I’m gonna chase you, okay?<br/>
Your feet must hurt from running around in my mind all day.</p>
<p>That real moment when we hold hands <br/>
makes me wishing that it never ends<br/>
Cos since we met it’s been you and I<br/>
a tear for a tear, baby an eye for an eye<br/>
And you know that my heart gon’ cry<br/>
If you leave me lonely<br/>
Cuz you're not just my love girl,you are my homie</p>
<p>I love you like a fat kid loves cake and sweets<br/>
I love you like a barbie loves makeup kits</p>
<p>And I know sometimes I try to get my plate full<br/>
it's because I can't get enough of you<br/>
the one lingering on my mind, that was always you <br/>
walked in my life and lit it up, girl you are my Noor </p>
<p>said you love apple, the forbidden fruit<br/>
I'll be your Adam girl, let's take a trip<br/>
to the garden together, that would be cute<br/>
apple juice on your lips, I'll take a sip</p>
<p>remember when you said you trust me, I hoped you meant it for real<br/>
cos I'd rather you trust me than be in love with me<br/>
I hope this words meet you well, make you fall on your knees<br/>
Will you be my girl again, please just tell me "OUI"</p>

Like you were with me on our first rendezvous

                Through the smooth and the rough <br/>

I'll show you nothing but love

              <p>
                A lot of time you tried to push me away<br/>
